This project is an undergraduate graduation design of Southwest Petroleum University: a wireless building fire alarm system based on zigbee

Now is Debug.

I modified it on github.

Now is Dev branch.

The core algorithms used in this design are: genetic algorithm, BP neural network algorithm, and fuzzy rule algorithm.
